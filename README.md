### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics and Programme Director of the MSc in Economic Policy at Trinity College Dublin.

My research focuses on the design of the tax and welfare system, and the evolution and distribution of living standards in Ireland. 

I previously worked as an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London.

I was a member of the Irish Government's 2021-22 Commission on Taxation and Welfare whose report you can find here. 

My email address is barra [dot] roantree [at] tcd [dot] ie and you can follow me on Twitter @barratree. I write an occasional newsletter on Irish economic & social policy which you can sign up for at https://tinyurl.com/barranewsletter
